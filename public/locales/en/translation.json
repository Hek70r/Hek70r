    "discordMusicApp": "A web application that facilitates group music listening and managing favorite tracks using a Discord music bot. Users can register, add songs using the YouTube API, categorize them, 'like' them, and create their own playlists. The project leverages Angular for a dynamic user interface and Node.js with MongoDB on the backend, ensuring security with JWT. A unique feature is the ability to customize the music bot command prefixes (e.g., /play), which simplifies song requesting directly on the Discord server, enhancing user interactivity."
